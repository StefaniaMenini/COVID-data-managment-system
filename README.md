# COVID-data-managment-system
Final academic team project for *"Data Management & SQL"*, a curricular course attended throughout the spring semester of my second master's degree in *Business Analytics* at Hult International Business School. 
My team and I have been tasked to create a *COVID Data Management System* to help Health Care Centers report and store vaccination data efficiently. By designing our SQL database we had the opportunity to *improve our skills* in the following *areas*:
- Flow of System
- Database structure
- Entity-Relational (ER) Model
- SQL queries 
- SQL procedures
